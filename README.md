# The Playlist

An app to browse and create youtube playlists. The playlists are independant of youtube and do not require a youtube channel.  In the future we will be adding features and quality of life changes. There are still some bugs that need to be fixed, but for the most part it is fully functioning.

## Features
The user can
*  Browse playlists 
*  Create a profile
*  log in with username and password 

When the user is logged in, they can 
*  Create a Playlist
*  Edit the Playlist
*  Delete the Playlist 

### Youtube intergration 

We used the youtube API to embed a search function so the user can search through Youtube on the app. We used an iframe to embed the video playlist.

### Javascript libraries

* JQuery
* Bootsrap
* Popper
* Velocity
